# Galaxy production server (2018-11-05)

I'm installing a Galaxy server in production mode in my workstation. This has two aims:

* Make it easy for the Genetics platform staff to execute reproducible, complex analyses.
* Compare Galaxy, which I already know, with the tool offered by [DREAMgenics](https://www.dreamgenics.com).
